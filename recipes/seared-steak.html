        Those who are familiar only with barbeque steak don't know what they are missing out on! This way of preparing steak is easy 
        while also being surprisingly flavorful. The key is to know when to take the steak off of the heat. If you want your steak
        to turn out medium-rare, it is important to take it off <i>earlier than you think,</i> because the steak will actually still
        be cooking when you take it off! When it sits by itself, the meat continues cooking for several minutes. So it's very tricky
        to know when the right time to take it off the heat is. But trust me, it is also very rewarding!
